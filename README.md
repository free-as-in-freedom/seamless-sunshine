# seamless-sunshine
Seamless Sunshine is basically a mix of a few toold to turn your Windows Machine into the best possible Sunshine Streaming for a steam deck. This is accomplished by creating hotkeys that automatically set up a virtual third monitor and disable your main monitors, and creating other hotkeys that reset your setup back to normal. Much of this is easily attributable to other devices besides the Steam Deck if you know how to set up a remote streaming application (e.g. [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream)) and know the device's resolution and framerate.
